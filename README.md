# Need-for-Speech

### How to play

The car is controlled by **sound volume** (Speed) and **pitch** (direction). 
The game uses the default microphone for input. 
In the Menu the car models are selectable by sound volume.
The View can be switched by pressing `Esc`.

### Settings

Pitch cannot (yet) be calibrated, but you can change it in Unity under `AudioController -> Audio Input -> Minfreq/Avgfreq/Maxfreq`
